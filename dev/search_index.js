Default = \"#444\"\nborderwidth::Int - Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. Default = 0\ndtick::Union{Float64,Int,String} - Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis type is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L<f>\", where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis type is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set tick0 to \"2000-01-15\" and dtick to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set dtick to \"M48\"\nexponentformat::String - Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000.

If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden.\nshowticksuffix::Bool - Same as showtickprefix but for tick suffixes.\nthickness::Int - Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels.\nthicknessmode::String - Determines whether the thickness of the color bar is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use thickness to set the value.\ntick0::Union{Float64,Int,String} - Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with dtick. If the axis type is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the tick0 to 2) except when dtick=L<f> (see dtick for more info), where the axis starts at zero. If the axis type is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis type is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.\ntickangle::Union{String,Int,Float64} - Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a tickangle of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.\ntickcolor::String - Sets the tick color.\ntickformat::String - Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"\ntickformatstops::Dict - Array of object where each object has one or more of the keys - \"dtickrange\", \"value\", \"enabled\", \"name\", \"templateitemname\"\nticklabeloverflow::String - Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis.

Type: number greater than or equal to 0.1\nax::Union{String,Int,Float64} - Sets the x component of the arrow tail about the arrow head. If axref is pixel, a positive (negative) component corresponds to an arrow pointing from right to left (left to right). If axref is not pixel and is exactly the same as xref, this is an absolute value on that axis, like x, specified in the same coordinates as xref. Type: number or categorical coordinate string\naxref::String - Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a ax axis id (e.g. \"ax\" or \"ax2\"), the ax position refers to a ax coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the ax position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the left (right). If set to a ax axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"ax2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second ax axis and a ax position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second ax axis. In order for absolute positioning of the arrow to work, \"axref\" must be exactly the same as \"xref\", otherwise \"axref\" will revert to \"pixel\" (explained next). For relative positioning, \"axref\" can be set to \"pixel\", in which case the \"ax\" value is specified in pixels relative to \"x\". Absolute positioning is useful for trendline annotations which should continue to indicate the correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated point.

Type: number or categorical coordinate string\nayref::String - Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a ay axis id (e.g. \"ay\" or \"ay2\"), the ay position refers to a ay coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the ay position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a ay axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"ay2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second ay axis and a ay position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second ay axis. In order for absolute positioning of the arrow to work, \"ayref\" must be exactly the same as \"yref\", otherwise \"ayref\" will revert to \"pixel\" (explained next).

By default captureevents is \"false\" unless hovertext is provided. If you use the event plotly_clickannotation without hovertext you must explicitly enable captureevents.\nfont::Font - Sets the annotation text font.\nheight::Int - Sets an explicit height for the text box. null (default) lets the text set the box height. Taller text will be clipped. Type: number greater than or equal to 1\nhoverlabel::Dict -  object containing one or more of the keys listed: bgcolor bordercolor font\nname::String - When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array.

Has no effect outside of a template.\nopacity::Float64 - Sets the opacity of the annotation (text + arrow). Type: number between or equal to 0 and 1 | Default: 1\nshowarrow::Bool - Determines whether or not the annotation is drawn with an arrow. If \"true\", text is placed near the arrow's tail. If \"false\", text lines up with the x and y provided. Default: true\nstandoff::Int - Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end arrowhead away from the position it is pointing at, for example to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom.

Note that this shortens the arrow from the ax / ay vector, in contrast to xshift / yshift which moves everything by this amount.  Type: number greater than or equal to 0 | Default: 0\ntemplateitemname::String - Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with templateitemname matching its name, alongside your modifications (including visible: false or enabled: false to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with visible: true.\ntext::String - Sets the text associated with the annotation. Plotly uses a subset of HTML tags to do things like newline (<br>), bold (<b></b>), italics (<i></i>), hyperlinks (<a href='...'></a>). Tags <em>, <sup>, <sub> <span> are also supported.

Type: number greater than or equal to 1\nx::Union{String,Int,Float64} - Sets the annotation's x position. If the axis type is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range. If the axis type is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.\nxanchor::String - Sets the text box's horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the x position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the annotation. For example, if x is set to 1, xref to \"paper\" and xanchor to \"right\" then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"center\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. Type: enumerated , one of ( \"auto\" | \"left\" | \"center\" | \"right\") | Default: \"auto\"\nxref::Union{String,Int,Float64} - Sets the annotation's x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis id (e.g. \"x\" or \"x2\"), the x position refers to a x coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the x position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"x2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis.

If the axis type is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis type is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.\nyanchor::Union{String} - Sets the text box's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the y position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the annotation. For example, if y is set to 1, yref to \"paper\" and yanchor to \"top\" then the top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the top-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"middle\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. Type: enumerated , one of ( \"auto\" | \"top\" | \"middle\" | \"bottom\") | Default: \"auto\"\nyref::Union{String,Int,Float64} - Sets the annotation's y coordinate axis.

Only has an effect if categoryorder is set to \"array\". Used with categoryorder. Type: Vector \ncategoryorder::String - Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set categoryorder to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set categoryorder to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute categoryarray. If a category is not found in the categoryarray array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in categoryarray.

Use with tick0. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis type is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L<f>\", where f is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example tick0 = 0.1, dtick = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). tick0 is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis type is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set dtick to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M<n>\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. n must be a positive integer.
